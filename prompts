 messages: user: Please help me build an internal POC that uses HCP Vault Dedicated. The objective is to create a local demo environment
 that simulates a user prompt to an AI agent via chat interface, and an agent that reads static Postgres credentials from Vault KV, connects directly
 to the database to return a value, and responds in natural language with a recommendation.
 
 Requirements: 
 - The POC must be able to be deployed locally on a macOS or Linux machine.
 - The POC must be able to be deployed using Rancher Desktop or Minikube (supported on this local system).
 - Vault should store a pre-created Postgres read-only credential in KV for the agent to consume.
 - The Postgres database should have a table that holds information on IBM automation software products, a description of the product, and a fictitious column of product owner names associated with the product.
 - The AI agent when prompted by a user should be able to authenticate to the database and use the table information to reason about responding to the user with potential multi-product solutions and recommended contacts for next steps.
